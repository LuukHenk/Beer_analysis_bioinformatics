# Beer analysis script

For the beer analysis script, the '../dataset/beers.csv' dataset was used
to create a plot between alcohol percentage and bitterness.

The plot was made using ggplot2.

```{r crafts_beer_data, echo=FALSE}
beerplot(crafts_beer_data)
```

The plot shows that there is a linear trend between alcohol percentage and 
bitteress.
